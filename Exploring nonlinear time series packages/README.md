# This is a folder full of forays into different nonlinear time series packages
These packages are either implemented in R or Python. 
The hope of this repository is to provide didactic tools to help people understand the nonlinear time series analysis options in a practical setting and to provide an insight into the back end of these packages that are currently used for nonlinear time series analysis

## List of packages  
### R packages
- Casnet ([Fred Hasselman])(https://github.com/FredHasselman/casnet)
- nonlinearTseries ([Constantino Garcia])(https://github.com/constantino-garcia/nonlinearTseries)
- RTisean (https://github.com/antoniofabio/RTisean)

### Python packages
- Pytisean (https://github.com/bogeholm/pytisean or https://github.com/galaunay/pytisean)
