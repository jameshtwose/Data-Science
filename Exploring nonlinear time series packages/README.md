# This is a folder full of forays into different nonlinear time series packages
These packages are either implemented in R or Python. 
The hope of this repository is to provide [__*higher level didactic tools*__](https://github.com/jameshtwose/Data-Science/tree/master/Exploring%20nonlinear%20time%20series%20packages/higher%20level%20didactic%20tools) to help people understand the nonlinear time series analysis options in a practical setting and to [__*show deep dives to provide an insight into the back end*__](https://github.com/jameshtwose/Data-Science/tree/master/Exploring%20nonlinear%20time%20series%20packages/deep%20dives) of these packages that are currently used for nonlinear time series analysis
